Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it.
It is a type of signal processing in which input is an image and output may be image or characteristics/features associated with that image.

Image Processing Operations:

  Color Space Conversion: Converts the loaded image from BGR to RGB using OpenCV.
  Image Concatenation: Horizontally concatenates the original and converted images side by side.
  Grayscale Conversion: Converts the image to grayscale using OpenCV.
  Negative Image: Inverts the grayscale image.
  Contrast Adjustment: Adjusts the contrast of the grayscale image.
  Gamma Correction: Applies gamma correction to the grayscale image.
